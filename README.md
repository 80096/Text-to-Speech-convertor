This Text-to-Speech-convertor is built solely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, its future scope includes enhanced cross-platform compatibility, user personalization,
 and expanded accessibility features. The project can evolve into a Progressive Web App, support multiple languages, and integrate with 
 browser extensions. Potential uses extend to educational tools for language learning and pronunciation, as well as integration with
 APIs for voice commands and cloud-based storage.
